# Native SPA Engine

This is a prototype of a native SPA Engine (like Angular, React, Vue, etc...) using Shadow Dom and thus not needing a compiler.

## Usage

Just run index.html on a Webserver or use the built in node http-server like this:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start

# open browser on localhost:3000
```
